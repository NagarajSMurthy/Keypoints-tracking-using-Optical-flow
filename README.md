# Keypoints-tracking-using-Optical-flow

Facial keypoints detection and tracking is an interesting field in computer vision. Deep learning models solves this problem with an amazing accuracy. However, in this repo, I have tried to implement the facial keypoints tracking using the concept of Optical flow in real-time. 

There are several algorithms proposed to solve the problem of Optical flow. I have used the Lucas-kanade method to track the landmarks. 

Steps:
1. Input the number of points to track (Say, x). 
2. Select the x points on the live video (Try to remain stil and then select).
